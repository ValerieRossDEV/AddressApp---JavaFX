# AddressApp---JavaFX
An address app made with JavaFX, in order to learn more about **JavaFX**.

Lots of thanks to https://www.swtestacademy.com/javafx-tutorial/ and https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/ .

Learned about JavaFX scenes, wrapping a root scene around another scene, properties in JavaFX, ChangeListener and Observableist interfaces as well as styling with CSS.

*To do at a later point: implement data persistence.*
